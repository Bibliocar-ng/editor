Text Editor
===========

I learned ncurses and figured why not.
Posting this now (9/30/15) because school is starting
so I don't plan on working on it anymore.

Probably the most well-developed program I made this summer.

##How to use:

    usage: text [ file ]

* F4 quits (after prompt)
* F5 saves the current file (untitled.txt is the default name)
* F6 saves the current file and allows you to specify the filename.
(WARNING: no confirmation screen or error checking yet).

##Current issues:

* Code could be organized better
* Some arguments/variables don't do anything
* Need to add copy/paste/undo.
